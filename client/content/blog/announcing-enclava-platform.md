Today, we're thrilled to announce the launch of Enclava—a platform designed to solve one of the most pressing challenges in enterprise AI: how to leverage powerful AI capabilities without compromising on data security.

## The Problem We're Solving

Enterprises are sitting on treasure troves of valuable data—customer insights, proprietary research, confidential communications. This data could power transformative AI applications, but security and compliance concerns often prevent organizations from fully utilizing it.

The traditional options are limited:

- **Public cloud AI**: Fast to deploy but requires trusting external providers with sensitive data
- **On-premises solutions**: Secure but expensive, complex, and hard to scale
- **Not using AI at all**: Safe but increasingly a competitive disadvantage

## Our Solution

Enclava bridges this gap with **confidential computing**. We've built a platform that allows you to:

- Run state-of-the-art AI models on your most sensitive data
- Maintain complete data sovereignty—your data never leaves encrypted hardware enclaves
- Deploy in your infrastructure or ours, with the same security guarantees
- Get started in hours, not months

## Two Deployment Options

### Self-Hosted Platform

Deploy Enclava in your own data center or cloud account. You maintain full control while we handle the complexity of confidential computing infrastructure.

### Managed Cloud

Let us manage the infrastructure while you focus on building AI applications. Your data remains protected by hardware security—we literally cannot access it.

## What's Next

We're just getting started. Our roadmap includes:

- Expanded model support for specialized enterprise use cases
- Advanced RAG capabilities for knowledge bases
- Multi-party computation for secure collaboration

We believe every enterprise should be able to use AI without compromising on security. Enclava makes this possible.
